# fastSparse

This page contains the demo code to plot the step functions shown in our AISTATS 2022 paper: 

* [Fast Sparse Classification for Generalized Linear and Additive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11389)

You can simply run the jupyter notebook to reproduce the FICO step functions shown in the paper. Or you can modify the notebook to tailor to plot step functions on your own data.

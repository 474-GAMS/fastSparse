Description: We provide a toolkit for producing sparse and interpretable generalized linear and additive models for the binary classiciation task by solving the L0-regularized problems.
    The classiciation loss can be either the logistic loss or the exponential loss.
    The algorithms can produce high quality (swap 1-OPT) solutions and are generally 2 to 5 times faster than previous approaches.
    We propose several techniques to achieve this computational speedup.
    For fast sparse logistic regression, we propose to use linear and quadratic surrogate cuts that allow us to efficiently screen features for elimination, as well as use of a priority queue that favors a more uniform exploration of features.
    As an alterantive to the logistic loss, we propose the exponential loss, which permits an analytical solution to the line search at each iteration.
